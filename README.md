# Training Machine Learning models with galaxy image data -- using supervised and self-supervised learning

## Dataset
We are using GalaxyML dataset which is available in Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/13878122. We have used the 64x64 size images. The scripts assume that the data `(*.hdf5)` files are downloaded in a directory named ```Data/```. If your data is located in a different location please change the file paths in `prepare_data.py` accordingly.
